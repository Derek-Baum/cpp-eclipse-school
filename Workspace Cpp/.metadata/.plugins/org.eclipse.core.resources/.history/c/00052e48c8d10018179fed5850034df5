	 * STRONGLY recommend you do as well. All codes for every leaf can
	 * be found in one pass of the tree with recursion.
	 * One final note: I made a new linked list (assigned to pq, since
	 * I was done with the old pq, with each leaf node and its code bein
	 * added to the linkde list. This linked list of characters and codes
	 * will be used to create the compressed version of the file, in
	 * which each character is replaced with its corresponding code. This
	 * would be alot easier with a hash table/map, but we haven't worked
	 * with them yet. If you want to make a new field and create a hash
	 * table for this part, I am fine with that.
